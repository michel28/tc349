	The first thing that stands out is the fact that the calendar icon is not representative of today's date. Having an actual date on this icon would serve a very practical purpose, and couldn't be hard to code into the page. The second aspect of the site that I don't enjoy is the "MSU MOBILE" title at the top. There is such limited 'property' on a mobile device that I don't see the benefit of including the word MOBILE, a fact that is quite obvious seeing as one would be viewing this site on a mobile device. One additional complaint I have is the fact that this mobile site does not have  the same branding designs that the University has established. 
	One very unique feature of this sit is the customizable home page. It blurs the line between a website and an App. Considering many students would use this site, it's great that people can customize the site to fit their needs.
	The nesting of the menus is very impressive. Each page is very much designed for mobile without any unnecessary information. The menus are concise and allow you to easily find what you're looking for. The Library page shows today's schedule before it shows the weekly schedule. This is very much putting the needs of the user at the forefront of the design.
