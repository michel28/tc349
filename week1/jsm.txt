jasonsantamaria.com - a review

The website of graphic designer Jason Santa Maria is modern enough to be culturally relevant, yet classic enough to maintain quick legibility. The white background allows for the artwork and design-work to really speak for itself. It’s this neutral ground that causes the viewer’s eyes to focus on the thumbnail images and spark interest in exploring more of his work. The subtle use of a dulled red adds some energy to the page, preventing the content from being simply lost in a vast white field. The typography is well placed and sized with appropriate font-families. Sans Serif type brings in a modern feel that is open and clean, while the traditional serif font allows for easy legibility. I find it interesting that the body text inside each post is larger than the average website font-size; another means of improving comprehension.

The layout of the site is very clean and simple, with a focus on content. While some artists’ sites rely too heavily on their web design to portray themselves as an artist, Jason Santa Maria simply lets his artwork speak for itself. The large amount of white spaces allows for a calming read instead of one being overwhelmed by large bodies of text. The structure of the website as a whole is also very manageable to navigate.

Overall this site creates a clean backdrop for presenting an artist’s work in a very accessible and approachable environment.
