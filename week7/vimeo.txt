As a film major, I'm very familiar with vimeo and conscious of the recent redesign that they launched within the past year. The design focuses much more on showcasing the videos, and letting everything else fall to the side in the hierarchy of content.
The menu navigation is something that stands out with this site. Instead of nested menu items appearing in the standard vertical arrangement, upon "mousing-over" the menu bar, a second sub-menu bar appears. And that sub-menu bar changes based on the location of the mouse in the main menu bar. This is a much easier way of viewing the site navigation, and it also serves to not cover the playing video with a drop down menu. [Again keeping the video at the forefront of their site design.]
The standard video viewing size is much larger than on other sites. Rather than having suggested videos on the side of the site, like youtube, the suggested "more videos" are hidden at the top and made visible by clicking on the "more videos" tab. The design is a clean white and light gray with a top border of a rainbow pattern. All of these things re-emphasize the importance of the video and are intentional efforts to not distract from the most important part of the site.
