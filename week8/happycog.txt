I really love the header and menu bar action of this site. It is such a nice intro image that then goes away once you start scrolling, but the menu bar remains at the top of the window. It functions as a welcome page, but is incorporated into the home page to do away with the need of coding an additional page as well as the additional loading time. It's also very nice visually that all the content is essentially one long scroll. It gives the viewer the option to read through the whole page and receive all the content, or skip ahead to their favorite part. The motion of this is also a pleasing effect.
The overall layout is very open and clean. The site isn't overwhelming to the eyes and each piece of content takes up more space than it seems it needs. This is done tastefully to promote an easy "consumption" of information, yet the site doesn't feel too empty. The font choices and letting of the text also adds to this ease and comfortability of taking in the site's information.
The responsive design of this site is quite nice. The manipulation of the menu bar with the window resize is great. Once it gets down to the mobile size the menu disappears to leave the logo and content [the most important part] at the top of the page. Since the menu already exists at the bottom, this mobile size prevents the redundancy of a top menu bar.
Overall this is a very well designed site both visually and functionally. It contains a large amount of content, but is easily digested and at no point is the viewer overwhelmed.
