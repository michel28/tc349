The mobile version of Bandcamp is a much more pleasing experience compared to the standard desktop experience. The design on a mobile device is streamlined and and the hierarchy of content is extremely well established. The largest and topmost element is the album cover. As a visual oriented person, I remember albums by the cover art, and appreciate the album art equally as I do the music. Below this is a play button to listen to the music. Bandcamp is all about getting your music out there, so having the play button near the top just makes sense. The whole hierarchy of art, play, buy, share, track listing, about the album, about the artist, discography, bandcamp info is just a perfect order in which to present this content.

The mobile design is also standardized across all personal bandcamp pages. There is a black ground on which the album art sits as well as the gray toned type. This is a very pleasing design that also portrays a more professional/elegant image. This eliminates the distraction that much of the bandcamp customizable design can be.
