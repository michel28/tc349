Review of Etsy.com
The first thing I notice in looking at Etsy is the fact that it has a clean and unifying design. Everything visually works. The people behind Etsy know their audience and cater towards them very well. They have a very similar style to the "Pinterest" culture of clean white design with multiple squares of content that contain well composed and engaging photographs. There are extensive menus on Etsy's homepage which can be a little daunting, but it's easier for an artist-minded person to see the whole picture rather than a number of nested menus that have to be navigated.
There are a number of "hover" items that are incorporated into their design. All the links get an underline with a hover, and the top menu bar items get a darker background with each mouse-over. As for the content blocks, a small heart shows up with each mouse over. This indicates the social aspect of Etsy. One can "like" different items to keep stored for later or for sharing with others. There is also Facebook and Twitter integration with the site to further share interesting items. The whole website is centered in the browser in much the same way as we centered our "Recipe" and "Personal" sites. The "Register" and "Sign In" buttons have slight drop shadows.
The website design as a whole relies heavily on photographs. This emphasizes the focus on the goods and wares that are being sold. There aren't other aspects of the website that distract the viewer from simply experiencing that which Etsy is all about: discovering new art, artists, and fellow creatives.
