Chartbeat is a very engaging design. The website has a feeling of interactivity that causes the viewer to stay engaged with the site and [from personal experience] scroll up and down to see how the elements of the site change.
This site does a great job and portraying to its potential clients how the site can work. This business tracks web usage and when a potential client visits the site, they are shown their own current usage statistics. This directly shows the effectiveness and purpose of this site.
The structure of this site is laid out more as an experience than as an informative site. It shows its content rather than tells about it. To a designer, this is a strong marketing technique.
