For my final project, my plan is to create a website that I can use as a hub for all my creative work. This includes photography, videography, graphic design, and musical endeavors. I long to have a website that portrays me as a whole person, both conveying my personal character as well as my artistic pursuits as a whole. This will also serve as a platform for interaction with my clients. Private photo galleries as well as public portfolios will be used to showcase my photographic work. I long to maintain a minimal design that is heavily based on graphic design. I also hope for this site to be responsive in the design to maintain its unifying design qualities.
