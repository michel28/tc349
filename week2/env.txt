Having only really extensively used WYSIWYG editors in the past, my review of these text editors is quite limited and some of my opinions are based on other user reviews. However I have opened them all on my machine and tried a number other features with the small code we wrote for this first assignment.

Aquamacs:

This editor, as stated by many reviews, is an older program as can be seen by it’s interface design. It functions well as getting the text into one location, yet does not have the organizational aids found in other text editors.


Smultron:

This has a very nice interface. It is clean and not overcrowded with buttons and features. The split screen is very nice  for referencing existing projects or found code. It’s also a small thing, but the sequential numbers existing on the left hand side is nice for keeping my code straight while working. The color coding is also quite nice for keeping everything straight.

TextWrangler:

One great feature [which is present in other editors, but highlighted in this program] is the find/replace option for helping clean up my own multiple mistakes when coding. The layout of this editor also caters for the frequent coder. I really appreciate keeping the 10 most frequent files accessed on the left hand column. Also, there is an option for collapsing all content within each set of div tags, which allows one to view a small portion of code without being overwhelmed by the whole. For these reasons I'm choosing this editor to use for this course.

I'm using firefox as my internet viewer. I enjoy this layout of this web browser and it is the most reliably functional web browser I have used over the years. It is also what I'm accustomed to, and simply enjoy its interface.
