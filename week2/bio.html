<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Josh Michels is currently finishing up a degree in film and graphic design from Michigan State University. Apart from these more digitally based art forms, Josh is strongly drawn to the traditional tactile arts such as ceramics and painting. There is something so fulfilling about using a brush to pull paint across a canvas and create a physical piece you can interact with, all from a simple idea. His artistic side is also broadened with his musical pursuits. His original plan was to go into cello performance, but as college approached, he decided he'd much rather pursue a wide range of the arts rather than solely music. However, his musical pursuits have not diminished due to not studying music at the University. Josh is an active member of Michigan-based folk band <a href="http://www.dougmainsmusic.com">Doug Mains & The City Folk</a> in which he plays the cello and accordion. The one thing that attracts Josh most about music is the ability to connect with an audience and fellow musicians. No words need to be spoken, nor a previous knowledge of a fellow musician, but through music, one can speak directly to the emotions and engage with someone in a purely artistic manner.</p><p>Biking is one of Josh's great loves. He has chosen to not own a car and use his bike, which is named Beauford, as his sole means of transpiration. He loves the ability to bike within a city and truly understand and engage in one's surroundings rather than simply go through a city inside four walls that separate you from all of nature and human interaction. This idea of embracing community and engaging in those around you played a large part in a feature length documentary that Josh co-directed/produced in the spring of 2012. The film, which carries the title Thrive With Less, portrays the journey of six college students that pursue a life of moderation and discover there's so much more to life, when the "more" is stripped away. The project's blog and trailer can be found at <a href="http://www.thrivewithless.com">ThriveWithLess.com</a></p><p>Upon graduation in December of 2012, Josh intends to pursue music and photography full time. He started his own photography business in 2011 and continues to branch out in his photographic work. The thing that most attracts Josh to photography as well as documentary work is the ability to tell someone's story in an engaging and artistic manner. He longs to engage in his greater society by producing films that address relevant topics in a format that promotes a dialogue of the greater themes within.</p><p>To contact Josh and view his most recent work, please visit <a href="http://www.joshuamichels.com">JoshuaMichels.com</a></p><h1>Critique</h1>
