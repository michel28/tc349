Untitled Pixelworkers is a very well designed site. The typography and design work perfectly well. The crispness of the boxes matches the [I'm assuming] use of Futura Bold very nicely. The subtle lift each box has with a mouse-over is a nice way to highlight the selected item. The responsiveness of this site is also very well done. Everything works amazingly well on a large scale as well as a mobile size.
This site focuses on its product and lets the shirts speak for themselves. There isn't a lot of text or other content to distract from showcasing what this company is about. This is something that many people lose focus of in today's society. They are more preoccupied with promoting a product than just developing a product that is desirable and letting it speak for itself. 
While this site has the product at the forefront of its design, it puts the social media links within the collage of t-shirts. This is a smart way of letting the social media links be hidden among the content that is at the top of the hierarchy of importance, so that those links, while lower in the hierarchy, are seen at the same time.
Again, a very well designed site.
