		<article>
		<p>One pensive troubadour, three classically trained bowed-string musicians and 		one dynamic percussionist come together as Doug Mains &amp; the City Folk. This five-piece, with their roots planted in Michigan, bears a rich, smooth and unique sound refreshing to the progressive world of indie folk. With classical undertones, hints of old time folk as well as meaningful lyrics and &ldquo;a voice that will reach into your soul&rdquo;, Doug Mains & the City Folk are living up to what has been said about them; they are indeed &ldquo;destined to be a Michigan icon of great Americana music.&rdquo; </p>
