	<h3>SEPTEMBER 14, 2012</h3>
	<p>Hey friends! Today we released our 6 track live EP for the world to hear. In November of 2011, the five of us partnered up with Groove Box Studios in Detroit to produce a live EP as well as an accompanying <a href="https://vimeo.com/33121283">music video</a>. The whole idea is one band, one room, one take. So yes, we recorded all of this music in one night with no retakes and no overdubs. Be sure to check out the great things that our friends at <a href="http://www.grooveboxstudios.com/">GBS Detroit</a> are continuing to do!

The release of this EP coincides with the trailer release of the documentary <a href="http://gnmovie.com/">Black Air: The Buick Grand National Documentary</a> in which our song "Stones Awakening" is featured. Doug also worked with the filmmakers to write an original soundtrack to be featured in the film.

The EP "Live @ GBS Detroit" can be streamed and purchased online at our <a href="http://dougmains.bandcamp.com/album/live-gbs-detroit">Bandcamp</a> page. We greatly appreciate any support you give, and would love it if you shared this EP with your friends. Thanks so much!!

	<p>Musician:<a href="http://www.facebook.com/lizmcdanielmusic?ref=ts"> Liz McDaniel</a>
A couple of years back, I ran an open mic in Lansing that, in it, we were fortunate enough to host some very impressive musicians and artists. Though still in high school, Liz would occasionally come and I had the privilege to meet and see her perform for the first time. A couple of years later we shared a stage in Saginaw and I was blown away by her set. She has such a beautiful voice accompanied by delicate guitar and fantastic lyrics. It is safe to say that she is one of my favorite local musicians. Though she now lives in Nashville, Liz is coming back home to release a long-awaited album this Saturday, June 2 in Okemos, MI. Here is the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/431056533571834/">Facebook invite</a>...you won't be disappointed if you go!</p>
	<h3>MAY 22, 2012</h3>
	<p>Needless to say, but say i will, Chicago has treated me very well. Not only have I loved experiencing places and things in Chicago that you can't find in your tourist brochure, I have already met so many great people and impressive musicians. I have gone to three open mics in the past two nights and overall they have all been very impressive as far as talent and setup. At this point, I can't tell if I just did a good job at picking good open mics out, if I just got lucky or if all open mics in this city are pretty good. There is definitely enough talent in the city to fill up all the open mic stages available. 

It really has been a great thing for me; to enter into a larger, more competitive music scene. It definitely brings to surface the reality that the music industry is a very large ocean that you could easily sink in and only hope to swim in. I do believe that the days of just waiting to be discovered are somewhat over and it is now a bit more about working hard to take advantage of all the resources that are so readily available to independent artists. Coming to Chicago has only reinforced something big that I have been continuously learning over the past five years; being a musician is no easy task.

Though some may mistake my baby face for one of a teenagers, I am no high schooler. But I have been one and I admit now that I shared an ignorant perspective that so many young artists continue to have. It is so common for young musicians to assume that the musician life is the easy life with no responsibility or real work to be done. Contrarily, I have been learning more and more that the deeper and more successful i have become in my own music career, the harder it gets. There is work to be done and responsibility to embrace. Booking shows, managing a band, building a fan-base, writing songs are some of my main duties as an independent musician but these are only the categories! In each of these responsibilities, there are loads of other tasks that need to be done in order to reach any slight success in any one of them. On top of all this, there really is no formula to any of it, which makes it even more challenging, overwhelming and unpredictable. The musician life is certainly not the easy life, at least not for me.

But, like I have said before, the fact that there are no absolute rules to how you approach the music scene is a main reason why I am growing to love it more and more. Yes, I am constantly challenged by many things in what i do and i consistently struggle to answer many questions of "how" (How do we spread the word? How do we stand out above the rest? How do we make money? Etc.) But, it is these challenges and struggles that answer the question of why I love doing what i do. It is not an easy business to get into at all yet I can't think of any easier work for me to do. And in the end, you can only do it if you love doing it.

In other news, I have been learning lately that songwriting is really about clearing your mind of all the pressures from others and myself to write a good song and allowing the song to write itself. If you try too hard to write a great song, you probably won't write one. Maybe the business side of music works the same way. In all the craziness of it all, you have to be okay with clearing your mind of the pressures to be successful and just do what you do, own what you do and love what you do.</p>

	<p>Mondays, how boring you are. I think I just decided to do my part in making Mondays a bit more exciting. 

I love connecting with people. Love it. I love experiencing what other people are doing and helping to support the local arts in anyway I can. That being said, I want to introduce a new series of blogposts that I hope to write every Monday. These posts will simply feature friends and local artists that I like, am excited about and want you to know! So here we go! Take one:

Musician: Tyler Stitt
It is only appropriate that this blogpost series starts with the guy whose music I am listening to right now. I met Tyler a while ago at a Grand Rapids open mic and was immediately excited about his talent and how he was using it. He just released an e.p. called "A Piece of Light". Its his first e.p. release and it is great! Give it a listen <a href="http://tylerstitt.bandcamp.com/">here</a>.

Art in Community: <a href="http://www.thedickandjaneproject.org/">The Dick & Jane Project</a>
Please check these guys out! I had the extreme privilege of meeting Ben, the executive producer on my open mic tour in Columbus. This organization incorporates so many of my passions in an impressive fashion. Summarized, they connect local musicians with public middle school students to coach them in the art of songwriting. The kids write the songs and the musicians arrange and record the music. The end product is a well recorded compilation CD featuring local artists giving a voice to local middle schools students. It is powerful to hear the lyrics written by students performed in such an impressive fashion. I love this model and hope that I can have the privilege of being a part of something like this in the future! To hear the songs and learn more about the Dick & Jane Project venture <a href="http://www.thedickandjaneproject.org/">here</a>! 

Film:<a href="http://thrivewithless.com/"> Thrive with Less</a>
I wouldn't say that I have had a front row seat to watch the Thrive with Less documentary project develop but maybe I've had a third or forth row seat. It has been awesome to see Josh Michels, our cellist, passionately working on this project. It is an awesome project. Him and five others have been working on this documentary that explores what it looks like to live in a culture of excess with less and how that affects relationships and all-around way of life. It is a great idea and has been executed very well. The doc releases online on May 30 but you can view a trailer and read more on their project on their <a href="http://thrivewithless.com/">website</a>. Do it!</p>
