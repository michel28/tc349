			<h2>Starting Out.</h2>
			<p>Growing up, my dad always had his film camera with him and would constantly be taking pictures. He always set up our own family portraits and had the push button to take it, and we have the photos with his arm going out of frame with the button in his hand! I think having grown up with a camera usually around, I had my interest peaked in the art of the photograph. I dabbled in taking pictures every now and then, but it was usually just casual snap shots with a disposable camera. It wasn't until coming to college that I was really introduced to actively taking photographs as art.</p>
			<p>My great friend freshman year was studying photography and a few times I snagged his Canon to nab a few pics here and there. I was amazed by what he could do with a camera, and decided I'd love to try things out for myself.</p>
			<h2>First Real Camera.</h2>
			<p>The summer after my freshman year I spent the summer in Denver, Colorado with my oldest brother Nate. While living out there I bought my first real camera. The Canon T1i. It came in the mail one afternoon, and the rest of my day was done. I scoured city park for anything I could take a picture of. Vines. Rocks. Squirrels. People. Trees. Chairs. I was in the thick of the "I just got a great camera so now I'm a photographer, let me take artsy photos of random objects" stage. Luckily I was pushed by others and myself to quickly move through this period of time that all photographers go through.</p>
			<h2>This is Real Now.</h2>

				<li><em>August 2011.</em> My friend calls me up and asks if I'd like to take engagement photos of her friends before they move overseas to teach English. Whoah. I never would have thought I'd have real photo shoots with clients, but I guess here it goes.</li>
