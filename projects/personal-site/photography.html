			<h2>Starting Out.</h2>
			<p>Growing up, my dad always had his film camera with him and would constantly be taking pictures. He always set up our own family portraits and had the push button to take it, and we have the photos with his arm going out of frame with the button in his hand! I think having grown up with a camera usually around, I had my interest peaked in the art of the photograph. I dabbled in taking pictures every now and then, but it was usually just casual snap shots with a disposable camera. It wasn't until coming to college that I was really introduced to actively taking photographs as art.</p>
			<p>My great friend freshman year was studying photography and a few times I snagged his Canon to nab a few pics here and there. I was amazed by what he could do with a camera, and decided I'd love to try things out for myself.</p>
			<h2>First Real Camera.</h2>
			<p>The summer after my freshman year I spent the summer in Denver, Colorado with my oldest brother Nate. While living out there I bought my first real camera. The Canon T1i. It came in the mail one afternoon, and the rest of my day was done. I scoured city park for anything I could take a picture of. Vines. Rocks. Squirrels. People. Trees. Chairs. I was in the thick of the "I just got a great camera so now I'm a photographer, let me take artsy photos of random objects" stage. Luckily I was pushed by others and myself to quickly move through this period of time that all photographers go through.</p>
			<h2>This is Real Now.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>August 2011.</strong> My friend calls me up and asks if I'd like to take engagement photos of her friends before they move overseas to teach English. Whoah. I never would have thought I'd have real photo shoots with clients, but I guess here it goes.</li>
				<li><strong>November 2011.</strong> "Ok cool!" After my friend asks me to partner up with him to shoot a wedding, dang this is quick.</li>
				<li><strong>August 2012.</strong> Shot four weddings this summer by myself with the occasional second shooter that I hired on.</li>
				<li><strong>September 2012.</strong> <em>She's been looking forward to these photos for years, and asked that I be the one to take them!</em> It's crazy to be on the camera side of senior portraits; on the production side of something the client has such high expectations for.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Amidst a Sea of Mediocrity.</h2>
			<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/34608191">Press Pause Play</a>. I love this film, yet it brings about an entirely new age for creatives and the art world. Everyone's an artist. Everyone is promoting themselves. I'm just one of the masses. So how do I stand out? As I move forward to pursue photography and documentary as a career, what is going to make me different? Even being an artist, I'm overwhelmed by the constant barrage of self-promotion that flies at me. I don't want to be a part of that. I want to connect with people on a human level. I want to be personable and reliable. I want to help others tell their stories. I and my clients are people first and foremost, and if I don't foster that relationship, there's no point in capturing their special day, their special moment, their highest expectations.</p>
