			<h2><em>"from a world that is breaking, like stones awakening we'll rise"</em></h2>
			<p>-one of the lyrics from the tune that my band loves to close each set with. <a href="http://reverbnation.com/dougmains">Doug Mains & the City Folk</a> is our name, and we describe out music as modern folk, as if the traditional folk from the mountains moved in to the city, hence "the city folk" :)</p>

			<p>Growing up I began playing cello and piano and as High School progressed, I firmly believed I was going to go into cello performance as my area of study and eventual career path. One month before my audition for music school I called the whole thing off.</p>
			<h2>I couldn't ever get away from it.</h2>
			<p>Music has followed me even when I dropped it as my path of life. My current band found be through a random connection of a mutual friend, and what began as me just trying it out with them at one show, has grown into me playing full time for two years and looking towards a career of music post-graduation. Quite the life progression that I never would have believed had someone told me about it back in High School, yet here I am, and this is my life.</p>
			<h2>Connecting solely in art.</h2>
			<p>One of my favorite things is playing music together with people that I've never met. We can sit down, throw out a few chord progressions and then make music for hours without stopping for a single word. We don't need to know each other's past. We don't need to know what we do as a day job. We don't need to hear each other's failures or successes. Music simply joins us in this moment and we can embrace each other in the music. It's like hanging out with someone's thoughts and emotions; you can feel them, but could never express them in concrete words. Regardless of my future in music as a band, I will never leave the cello behind.</p>
