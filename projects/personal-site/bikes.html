			<h2>Beauford, the love of my life [almost serious there.]</h2>
			<img src="file:///Users/joshmichels/Desktop/tc349/projects/personal-site/images/BicycleWEB.jpg" alt="BicyclePIC">
			<p><em>Two wheels, half as many as four yet more reliable, more convenient, more transportable, less expensive, less spacious, less destructive.</em> Ask me why I love to bike so much and I could rattle off hundreds of reasons. Not only do I use my bicycle for transportation, I simply love being on two wheels. My mind thinks in bikes, not in cars [which becomes dangerous when I happen to be driving a friend's car!]</p>
			<h2>Embracing the world, not cutting through it.</h2>
			<p>When you commute by bike, you truly feel the contour of the land and have a respect for the distance between places and the power of each hill and valley. My legs know how Lansing feels in the spring, summer, fall, and winter. My legs appreciate the plains of Colorado. My legs enjoy the slopes of the Upper Peninsula. My legs cry out when I keep them still in a four-wheeled box with windows.</p>
			<p>I love seeing the texture of a city as I am biking in it. I get to see the paint chips on houses. I get to see the expressions on people's faces and talk to them as I pass by. I am a member of the environment, not completely cut off from it in an isolated shell of constant temperatures, multitasking, shifting music and uncomfortable straps holding you down.</p>
			<h2>Freedom in the wind.</h2>
			<p>If it's not obvious, I'm quite against cars, and very much in favor of bicycles. Yes cars are necessary at times and many people need them all the time, but on the whole, our society could cut out a large majority of it's car usage and substitute in alternate forms of transportation, namely biking. There is such freedom in feeling the air flowing around you. There is such enjoyment in simply sliding my feet into my pedals and hitting the open road.</p>
